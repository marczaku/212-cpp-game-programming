# 212 C++ Game Programming

## Make a Game!
Make a Game!
- What kind of Game doesn't really matter.
- Use SDL Framework to make it.

Recommendation: Make a Cookie Clicker
- you click on a button
- you get a cookie
- for n cookies you can buy a cookie producer
- the cookie producer produces cookies in regular intervals

Command Patterns you can use:
- command for what happens when you click
- command for when cookies are produced
- prototype pattern for instantiating more cookied producers
- observer pattern to update the ui
- probably many more


## Passing Criteria
- Commit regularly
  - A Clear Progression must be visible from your commits
  - If there is a majority of the game made in one commit, you need to redo the assignment
  - This means that you need to do small iterative commits
    - add player sprite on screen
    - add player movement
    - add gravity
    - refactored player into two classes
    - add health and healthbar
    - ...
- Use at least one Design Pattern
- 2+ Screenshots
- 1+ Video
- Description of the Game in the Readme
- Upload a Build of the Game

## Excellent Criteria
- The Code uses at least 2 Design Patterns
- The Code makes use of at least two advanced C++ Features such as
  - runtime polymorphism
  - compile-time polymorphism
  - concepts
  - function pointers
  - collections
- Adding to above: Those two advanced features solve a problem effectively
